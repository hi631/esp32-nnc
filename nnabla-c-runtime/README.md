# NNabla C Runtime

This is a runtime library for inference Neural Network created by [Neural Network Libraries](https://github.com/sony/nnabla).


[Neural Network Libraries](https://github.com/sony/nnabla) and [Neural Network Console](https://dl.sony.com) can output DNN training result as [NNP](https://nnabla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) file.

[File Format Converter](https://nnabla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/file_format_converter/file_format_converter.html) can convert NNP file into `NNB` file interpreted by [Runtime](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-c-runtime/tree/master/src/runtime) or `C Source Code` to call [Functions](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-c-runtime/tree/master/src/runtime).

This library has the following features.

- It is almost **independent from external libraries** and is written in **Pure C** (C99).
  - *almost* mean it depends C standard math library.
- It has been developed with priority over **readability** rather than performance, making it ideal for learning and porting.
- It adopts an **extensible architecture**, and you can use the function you implemented yourself as necessary for applications that need performance.
- Provides [CLI utility](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-c-runtime/tree/master/src/nnablart) that can infer NNB file and dump NNB to confirm network I/O or function list.
